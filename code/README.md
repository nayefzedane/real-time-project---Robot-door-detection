Introduction

What is a Robot Guide?

A robot guide is designed to assist individuals with visual impairments in navigating safely and independently. The robot relies on various sensors, such as cameras, radars, and motion detectors, to scan its surroundings and detect obstacles.

However, there are also guide robots that operate solely using a camera, without additional sensors. These robots scan the environment through a camera to detect open doors, enabling them to navigate spaces more efficiently.

Advantages of a Camera-Only Robot Guide

Using only a camera instead of multiple sensors provides several advantages:

Lower Cost: The absence of additional sensors makes production significantly cheaper.

Easier Operation: Requires less maintenance compared to robots equipped with multiple sensors.

Portability: The design is smaller and more lightweight, making it easy to carry.

Challenges of a Camera-Only Robot Guide

While cost-effective and simpler, the lack of additional sensors presents challenges:

Limited environmental awareness compared to multi-sensor robots.

Dependency on optimal lighting conditions and clear visibility.

Project Goal

This project aims to develop a robot that can navigate out of a room independently using only a camera. To achieve this, we need to:

Develop an algorithm capable of detecting open doors in real-time.

Guide the robot based on the door's position in the captured image.

Door Detection Algorithm

Conclusion

A camera-only guide robot presents a cost-effective and accessible solution for visually impaired individuals. Despite its limitations, it provides a viable way to assist in navigation. This project successfully demonstrates an approach to detect open doors in real-time and guide the robot toward the exit.
